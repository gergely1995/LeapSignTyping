This project is intended for functionality experimentation so the UI is kept simple.

The idea is to create a stable and easy way to type using a touch less interface.

Actions:
All relevant actions have animated guide at the bottom of the page.
You can also refer to the demo video.

-numbers by holding up fingers
Used for selecting characters from the on screen alphabet.
Wait for about a second for response and make a fist each time after showing a number. (This is used for avoiding accidental triggers.)
The first number you show is the row.
Second number is the column.

-thumbs up and down (slightly tilted)
Upward used for confirming a selected character.
Downward used for cancelling the selection or backspace.

-swipe from left to righ with fist
Used for adding a space.
